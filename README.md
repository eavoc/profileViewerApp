# profileViewerApp
This MATLAB App handles raw Licel Data. It can read both binary files and ASCII files (generated with the Licel Advanced Viewer software).

Unfortunately the project was abandoned, hence there could be bugs and missing functions.
One missing function is the background removal and one bug is that, depending on your configuration of the Licel software TCPIP Acquis, you may have to edit the matlab functions readLicel.m and readLicelBin.m.
